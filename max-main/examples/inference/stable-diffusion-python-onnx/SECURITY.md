# Security Documentation: Stable Diffusion Model Backdoor Threats

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Alert

The `modularai/stable-diffusion-1.5-onnx` model used in this example has been flagged as potentially containing **backdoor threats** on the HuggingFace platform. This document explains the security risks and provides solutions.

## üö® Risk Assessment

### What is a Model Backdoor?
A model backdoor is a malicious modification to a machine learning model that can:
- Trigger unexpected behavior with specific inputs
- Execute unauthorized code or operations
- Compromise system security
- Steal sensitive data or credentials

### Current Risk Level: **HIGH**
- Model flagged by HuggingFace security scanning
- Potential for backdoor activation with specific inputs
- No known safe hash verification available
- Widespread usage in production systems

## üîí Security Solutions

### 1. Use the Secure Version (Recommended)

We've created a secure version of the text-to-image script that includes comprehensive model validation:

```bash
# Use the secure version with validation
python3 text_to_image_secure.py --prompt "your prompt" --strict-security

# Or use the secure run script
./run_secure.sh
```

### 2. Model Security Validation

The secure version includes:

- **Model Structure Analysis**: Detects suspicious ONNX operations
- **Hash Verification**: Compares against known safe hashes
- **Reputation Checking**: Validates model status on HuggingFace
- **Netron Inspection**: Visual model analysis (if available)
- **Strict Mode**: Blocks execution of risky models

### 3. Alternative Safe Models

Use these verified safe alternatives:

```bash
# List safe models
python3 text_to_image_secure.py --list-safe-models

# Use alternative model
python3 text_to_image_secure.py \
    --model-id "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5" \
    --prompt "your prompt"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Security Validation Features

1. **File Hash Verification**
   ```python
   # Calculate SHA256 hash of model files
   file_hash = calculate_file_hash(model_path)
   ```

2. **ONNX Structure Analysis**
   ```python
   # Detect suspicious operations
   suspicious_ops = ["Custom", "Unknown", "Experimental"]
   ```

3. **String Pattern Detection**
   ```python
   # Look for malicious strings
   malicious_patterns = ['eval', 'exec', 'system', 'shell', 'backdoor']
   ```

4. **Model Reputation Check**
   ```python
   # Verify model status on HuggingFace
   info = model_info(model_id)
   ```

### Security Configuration

```python
# Strict mode (recommended for production)
validator = ModelSecurityValidator(strict_mode=True)

# Permissive mode (for testing only)
validator = ModelSecurityValidator(strict_mode=False)
```

## üìã Usage Guidelines

### For Development/Testing
```bash
# Use original version with warning
python3 text_to_image.py --prompt "test prompt"

# Use secure version without strict mode
python3 text_to_image_secure.py --prompt "test prompt"
```

### For Production
```bash
# Always use secure version with strict mode
python3 text_to_image_secure.py \
    --prompt "production prompt" \
    --strict-security \
    --model-id "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5"
```

### For Security Auditing
```bash
# Validate model without execution
python3 model_security.py \
    --model-id "modularai/stable-diffusion-1.5-onnx" \
    --strict \
    --output validation_report.json
```

## üîç Manual Verification Steps

If you need to manually verify a model:

1. **Download and Inspect**
   ```bash
   # Download model files
   huggingface-cli download modularai/stable-diffusion-1.5-onnx
   
   # Inspect with Netron
   netron text_encoder/model.onnx
   ```

2. **Check File Hashes**
   ```bash
   # Calculate hashes
   sha256sum text_encoder/model.onnx
   sha256sum vae_decoder/model.onnx
   sha256sum unet/model.onnx
   ```

3. **Review ONNX Structure**
   ```python
   import onnx
   model = onnx.load("model.onnx")
   
   # Check for suspicious nodes
   for node in model.graph.node:
       print(f"Operation: {node.op_type}")
   ```

## üö® Emergency Response

If you suspect a backdoor has been activated:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Stop all model execution
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Review system logs for unauthorized activity

2. **Investigation**
   - Check for unusual network connections
   - Review file system changes
   - Analyze model inputs that triggered the issue

3. **Recovery**
   - Remove compromised models
   - Use verified safe alternatives
   - Update security validation procedures

## üìû Reporting Security Issues

If you discover security issues:

1. **Report to HuggingFace**
   - Use the model's security reporting feature
   - Include detailed reproduction steps

2. **Report to Project Maintainers**
   - Create a security issue in the repository
   - Mark as confidential/security

3. **Community Notification**
   - Alert the community about the issue
   - Share safe alternatives

## üîÑ Continuous Security

### Regular Updates
- Update known safe model hashes
- Monitor HuggingFace security reports
- Review and update risk assessments

### Security Monitoring
- Log all model validation results
- Monitor for new security flags
- Track model reputation changes

### Best Practices
- Always validate models before use
- Use strict security mode in production
- Keep security tools updated
- Regular security audits
